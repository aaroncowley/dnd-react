# React DnD

This application is an attempt to digitize the materials needed to play DnD as a player. Why do this when so many others have created similar applications? I wanted a good excuse to build a fun full-stack application that I would actually use

## Installation

This application requires npm to build and run.

Run npm install to install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run npm start to start dev server

```bash
npm start
```

## Pages

### Character Sheet

This page functions as a place to input character sheet information as well as store and load saved characters from the database.

### Roll

This page will function as a way to virtually roll dice and add modifiers to the rolls.

### Compendium

Will pull and sort pages from officially published guides and other wikis to create searchable reference for DMs and adventurers.

## API

The API provides RESTful resources to be utilized by the react application
